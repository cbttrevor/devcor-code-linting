## Learning Objectives

* Continuous testing is part of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

* Continuous testing provides rapid feedback to software development teams
* When people refer to continuous testing, they're often referring to continuous *automated* testing

* Manual testing requires additional effort during each release iteration
* Automating tests provides an alternative to authoring in-depth test documentation
* Instead of writing test documentation, just write an automated test. Another developer could come along and inspect what that test is doing.

* Continuous Integration tools:
    * Azure DevOps
    * AWS CodePipeline
    * GitHub Actions
    * GitLab Pipelines
