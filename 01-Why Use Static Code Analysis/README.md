## Learning Objectives

### Why Use Static Analysis?

* Static code analysis helps software developers identify formatting, best practices, and potential performance issues prior to compilation or deployment
* Linting can help avoid code duplication and keep a clean code base
* Security teams can use static analysis to detect potential vulnerabilities in software prior to deployment
* Reduces the number of software bugs that are detected during various testing phases

### What Is Static Analysis?

* Linters are often implemented as command line tools
  * These tools can be included in 
  * Linters integrate with Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
* Code linting tools are used to perform static analysis against a code repository
  * Each programming language has its own set of linting tools (ie. pylint for Python, eslint for JavaScript)
* Linting isn't limited to just programming languages. It can also apply to domain-specific languages (DSL) like Markdown
